# Physical Reservoir Control Program

# MATLAB Version
This code was developed using **MATLAB R2024a**. Versions later than R2024a should also be compatible.

# Required MATLAB Toolboxes
Please ensure that all toolboxes related to Simulink and Simscape are installed. For convenience and to avoid compatibility issues, we recommend **installing all available toolboxes** during MATLAB installation.

# Required MATLAB Apps
After installing MATLAB, open the application and navigate to "**APPS**" â†’ "**Get More Apps**". Install the following three packages:

1 **Robotics Playground**

2 **Robotics Playground Expansion Pack**

# Main Simulation Script
To run the simulation and collect data for the pendulum's free fall and swing-up tests using the physical reservoir, execute the following script: "**simulation code\PR_test_freedrop_continuous.m**"

# Physical Experiment Script

For MATLAB control Arduino, please also install **MATLAB Support Package for Arduino Hardware**
